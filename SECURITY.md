# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, email the maintainer with:
- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (or a PoC)
- Impact assessment (what could happen)

We’ll respond as quickly as we can and coordinate a fix/release.
